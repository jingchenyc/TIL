# TIL (Today I Learned)

## ðŸŒŸ About
Welcome to my TIL (Today I Learned) repository! This is where I document the small (and big!) things I learn each day as I dive deeper into computer science and software engineering. Think of it as a public learning journal where I can track my progress and maybe even help others along the way.

## ðŸ“‚ Categories
Here are some of the main topics Iâ€™ll be covering:
- **Programming languages**: JavaScript, Python, etc.
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: React, NestJS, etc.
- **Tools & DevOps**: Docker, Git, etc.
- **Miscellaneous**: Anything else that sparks my curiosity!

## ðŸš€ How It Works
- Each folder represents a category (like programming languages, frameworks, etc.).
- Inside each folder, youâ€™ll find markdown files, each describing something new I learned that day.
- Feel free to explore, learn something new, or contribute!

## ðŸ’¡ Why TIL?
- **Continuous Learning**: Learning doesnâ€™t stop! This repo helps me stay consistent.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: What I learn could be useful to someone else too.
- **Growth Tracking**: Itâ€™s always fun to look back and see how far youâ€™ve come!
